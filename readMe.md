# How To Submit Homework

You will be submitting your homework using GitHub Classrooms. 
  ### Here are the steps:
- Click on the link to your homework assignment that is posted in classroom channel.
- It opens up a tab in the browser and will ask you to accept the assignment. Accept it.

- It will re-direct you to a different page, here you might need to refresh your browser. Once you refreshed it, you should see **You're ready to go!** message. Below this message you will see link to your personal homework repository. Click it.

- Now, that you're redirected to your homework repo, you can check the success by looking at top left. If you see your GitHub handle to the right of the assignment name - success!

- Click on the `code` and choose `SSH` key and copy it.
- Now open your terminal, `cd` into your homework directory (create one if you don't have it yet) and run `git clone <SSH key>`. That action clones down your remote repository and if you run `ls` from your terminal you should see it right there!
- `cd` into repo that you just cloned down and you are ready to work on your homework!
